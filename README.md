# IT490-Project site-frontend-final
This branch stores all of the files for the frontend server, with the web files stored in the LibLibSite folder. Linking this folder to /var/www/html, or another folder in that directory, should allow us to edit the LibLibSite folder and have the changes appear on the web server without needing to manually move files.
